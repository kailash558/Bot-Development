Following steps follows Dispatch creation process -\n\n1. Create a LUIS app which recognize a particular intent.\n\n2. Create KB(s) as per requirement (single or Multiple).\n\n3. Open a command window and change directories to **CognitiveModels** folder.\n\n(This can be done by - Open then particular folder and in address bar type 'cmd' and hit 'enter')\n\n4. Now run following commands-\n\n\t`npm i -g npm`\n\n\t`npm -i botdispatch`\n\n5. Use `dispatch init` to initialize create a .dispatch file for dispatch model\n\n\t`dispatch init -n <filename-to-create> --luisAuthoringKey \"<your-luis-authoring-key>\" --luisAuthoringRegion <your-region> `\n\n6. Use `dispatch add` to add LUIS apps and QnA Maker KBs to the .dispatch file-\n\n**For Luis** -\n\n\t`dispatch add -t luis -i \"<app-id-for-luis-app>\" -n \"<name-of-luis-app>\" -v <app-version-number> -k \"<your-luis-authoring-key>\" --intentName l_luis`\n\n**For KB** -\n\n\t`dispatch add -t qna -i \"<knowledge-base-id>\" -n \"<knowledge-base-name>\" -k \"<azure-qna-service-key1>\" --intentName q_sample-qna`\n\n( 'qna-service-key1' is not a 'endpoint key' ok KB.
